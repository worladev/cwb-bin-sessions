TITLE: "Pangram Checker"

PROBLEM STATEMENT: A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. Your task
is to write a Python function is_pangram(sentence) that checks if a given sentence is a pangram or not.

Example:
sentence1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
result1 = is_pangram(sentence1)
print(result1)
# Output: True

sentence2 = "Hello, World!"
result2 = is_pangram(sentence2)
print(result2)
# Output: False
