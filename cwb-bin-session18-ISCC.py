You are tasked with creating a Python class GradeTracker to manage students' grades. The class should have the
following functionalities:

- Initialization: The class should initialize with an empty dictionary to store student names as keys and their
  corresponding grades as values.

- Adding Grades: Implement a method add_grade(name, grade) that takes a student's name (a string) and a grade
(an integer), and adds the grade to the student's record. If the student is not already in the records, add them.

- Getting Grades: Implement a method grades(name) that takes a student's name and returns a list of their grades
in ascending order.
