Title: Custom List Counter - Implement Your Own count() Function

PROBLEM STATEMENT: As part of your journey to become proficient Python programmers, you have been given a
challenge to implement your own version of the count() function for lists.
This function should count the occurrences of a specified element in a given list, just like the built-in
count() method in Python. Your task is to write a Python function custom_count() that replicates the
behavior of the count() method.

Instructions:
Implement a Python function custom_count(lst, element) that takes a list lst and an element element as arguments and
returns the count of how many times the element appears in the list.

# Test the custom_count function
             0         1         2       3         4       5
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'apple', 'grape', 'apple']
apple_count = custom_count(fruits, 'apple')
print("Number of apples:", apple_count)

numbers = ['3', '7', '2', '3', '1', '1', '3', '3', '7']
three_count = custom_count(number, '3')
print("Number of threes:", three_count)
