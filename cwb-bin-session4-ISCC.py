Title: Duplicate Letter Detector

PROBLEM STATEMENT: You are developing a spelling checker application that needs to identify the first letter
in a given word that appears twice. Your task is to write a Python function that takes a string containing
lowercase English letters and returns the first letter that appears twice in the word.

INSTRUCTION: Implement a Python function find_first_duplicate(s) that takes the following argument:

s: A string consisting of lowercase English letters.
The function should return the first letter that appears twice in the string s. If no letter appears twice,
return None.

Example:
word1 = "mississippi"
result1 = find_first_duplicate(word1)
print(result1)  # Output: 's'

word2 = "ghana"
result2 = find_first_duplicate(word2)
print(result2)  # Output: 'a'

word3 = "clean"
result3 = find_first_duplicate(word3)
print(result3)  # Output: 'None'
